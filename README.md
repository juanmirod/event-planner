# Event Meet-up planner

## Requirements

You do not need to create a functioning back-end or save user information. Only the form components themselves and their performance will be evaluated.

1) You do not need to create a real back-end or save user information, but the app must provide a form for users to create an account. Account creation should include, but is not limited to:

+ Name
+ Email address
+ Secure password (with character and length requirements)
+ Optional public biographical information (such as employer, job title, birthday, etc)

2) The app should allow users to create a new event. Each event should, at a minimum, allow a user to set:

+ Name of the event
+ Type of the event (birthday party, conference talk, wedding, etc.)
+ Event host (could be an individualâ€™s name or an organization)
+ Event start date and time
+ Event end date and time
+ Guest list
+ Location
+ Optional message to the guests with additional information about the event

3) The app should display events that have been created.

4) Review the evaluation rubric for this project early and often.
